# Private Swagger

This is a Zeit now project with a swagger serverless function, live at [https://private-swagger.now.sh](https://private-swagger.now.sh)

The swagger app is an express server which serves a password-protected swagger browser. Helpful if you'd like to refer to swagger files which are not public.

For more information, see [the function's readme](api/swagger/README.md)

To run, `yarn start` or `now dev`
